## 🌟 Welcome  

This repository is built for **biology students who want to learn Python** but don’t know where to start, feel intimidated, or think coding is “too technical.”  

Here, you’ll find simple, clear, hands-on notebooks that take you from **basics → BioPython → real biological workflows**.

No prior programming experience required.  
No jargon.  
Just practical learning you can understand and apply.

## Why I Created This ?

I started my Python journey with **zero coding background**, a lot of confusion, and the same fear many students have today.

But once concepts were explained simply, everything became much easier.

I realised something important:

### 👉 *Python is not difficult — it just needs beginner-friendly explanations.*

So I created this repository as a **tutor-cum-student**, to help others overcome the same fear and discover how approachable Python can be.

If I could learn it, **you can too**, and I want to make your learning journey simpler.
